        <b><h2>About Team Work</h2></b>
        The word ‘teamwork’ means working together as a team to achieve a particular goal. Humans are social animals. We tend to stick together and work alongside others in almost every phase of life. Be it in an office or home, everyone has his responsibilities to meet. Performing these responsibilities every day makes us a part of the team we are in. Upon doing their assigned work with proper coordination, a team always wins in achieving its goal.<br>Teamwork can be seen in a company, in the agricultural field, or any environment, you can name. Even the animals also perform as a team to survive in this competitive world. Cheetahs hunt together, wild dogs stay together avert danger, bees make their hives being united, and so on. It means that the success of a team depends on the performance of each member. They are called teammates.</header>

        <b><h2>Conclusion</h2></b>Teamwork means to work together with several people to achieve a goal that is common to all. We can say that teamwork is crucial for the functioning of an organisation. Without teamwork an organisation or company won’t be able to achieve its goals on time and this can lead to loss of energy and manpower. Every organisation or company has a division of many teams which perform specific tasks and without it the functioning of the organisation or company may get disrupted which will ultimately hinder the achievement of success and the goals set by them. This can affect the organisation or company and even the people working there. Every organisation or firm has a different hierarchy of teamwork too where the workload is evenly divided. This helps in maintaining the work balance and also equality among the members. Every team has a team leader or an expert that guides the whole team with their prior knowledge or experience. Humans are social beings and we are surrounded by one another in every stage of our life whether it is in home, school or office. All of us have certain goals and responsibilities we aim to achieve. All of this makes us part of the team. When we are assigned some work, then with proper coordination and planning we can always achieve the goal easily.</footer>

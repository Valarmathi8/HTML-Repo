    <b>Burning Fossil Fuel</b>
    <p>For millions of years, the concentration of <strong>greenhouse gases</strong> in the atmosphere fluctuated only slightly; <i>natural processes removed as many greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as were released</i>. <br>Problems emerged as we began to extract and <em>burn fossil fuels</em> on a large scale, thus releasing unprecedented amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The concentration of CO2 has increased by almost 50 percent since the Industrial Revolution.</p>
    <b>Man Made Emission</b>
    <p><mark>fossil fuels for electricity, heat, in industry and in transportation; deforestation; overuse of chemical fertilisers</mark> ; and industrial animal production all increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, <small>leading to global warming (more here)</small>. Future temperatures and the entire course of <ins>climate change are directly linked</ins> to the amount of greenhouse gases humans release into the atmosphere.</p>
    <b>A Vicious Cycle</b>
    <p>Along with these so-called anthropogenic emissions<sub> (emissions generated by human activity)</sub>, greenhouse gases leaking from melting soil (permafrost) or, for example, from drying peat bogs, play an increasingly important role. These are not released directly by humans, yet we are indirectly responsible for them by the role we continue to play in the warming of the planet. <sup>At the same time, frozen or snow-covered surfaces</sup> rneflect some of the sun's rays, and the melting of these surfaces darkens the Earth's, thus increasing its warmth.</p>

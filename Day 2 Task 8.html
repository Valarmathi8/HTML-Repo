    <h3>Isha</h3>
    <p>Isha Foundation is a nonprofit, spiritual organisation that was founded in 1992 near Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India, by Sadhguru.[1] It hosts the Isha Yoga Centre, which offers yoga programs under the name Isha Yoga. The foundation is run "almost entirely" by volunteers.[2][3][4] The word isha means "the formless divine"</p>
    <h3>Isha Yoga</h3>
    <p>The Yoga Centre at the Isha Foundation was founded in 1994,[7] and offers yoga programmes under the name Isha Yoga. This customised system of yoga[6] combines postural yoga with chanting, breathing (prāṇāyāma)[6] and meditation.[8] It does not belong to a lineage (paramparā), and its practitioners believe it to be based on the founding guru's unique insight.[8] Yoga classes for business leaders are intended to "introduce a sense of compassion and inclusiveness" to economics.[9][10]A yoga course for the Indian national hockey team was conducted in 1996.[11] Isha Foundation began conducting yoga programs in the United States in 1997[12][13] and, in 1998, yoga classes for life-term prisoners in Tamil Nadu prisons.</p>
    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <p>The foundation organises gatherings (sathsangs) with Vasudev in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where he delivers discourses, leads meditations, and conducts question-answer sessions.[15] It organises annual pilgrimages (yatras) to Mount Kailash and the Himalayas under Isha Sacred Walks.[citation needed] The Kailash-Manasarovar pilgrimage led by Vasudev is among the largest groups to visit Kailash, with 514 pilgrims making the journey in 2010.[16][17] The trip cost up to Rs ₹5 million (US$63,000) per person in 2021, with cheaper options available in which devotees receive limited interaction with Vasudev.[18]<br> centre hosts an annual seven-day-long music and dance festival culminating in the all-night celebration of Maha Shivaratri, a major Hindu festival honouring Shiva.[19]<br> foundation sells various products such as yoga mats, personal care products and accessories. Its US chapter reported revenues of $25m in 2020,[20] with the premium programmes being the largest source. The “business leadership” insights program, in particular, was priced at $6500 per person.</p>

    <p>My Educational Journey My educational journey has had good and challenging experiences. For the most part, my educational journey was positive. I only have a few memories that have been challenging at times. One of the most memorable experience that I had was having perfect attendance. Who would have thought at my age that I could look back and appreciate all my experience? As I look back at one of my good experience in my life, I would go back to my 6th grade year where I had the privilege of having both teachers, Mr. & Mrs. Redfield. They both had always supported my education and push me to do my best. They were like my fans on the sideline cheering me on every year I received a trophy or place for perfect attendance.

As a young kid, I would hear rumors from other kids saying that h was mean and rude in class. They would say not to take choir but I ignored them since I really enjoyed singing and I was going into his class very optimistic with whatever the turnout was going to be.

I felt sadden by his behavior towards us in class and sometimes he’s lack of encouragement to do well. Encouragement was always something that made me feel empowered to do well and set goals.

        I have two boys and I am a widow.<br> I did go to a vocational school to become a massage therapist, but it took a toll on my body. I recently worked at CIGNA insurance company for five years and thought I could give my boys a better life. I decided to come back to school and be dedicated to reach my goal. My goal is to become a radiologist technician. Porterville College doesn’t offer these classes. So, I am attending Porterville to do my prerequisite and then transfer to either to Bakersfield College or to Fresno City College. As I read College Fear Factor in our English class, I felt like I was connected to Eva in the beginning because she felt scared when her professor said she was going to do essay after essay, but when I read more into College Fear Factor I felt like I was more like Carlos. </p>
